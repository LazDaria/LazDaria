<span style="display: block; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; margin-top: 5px;"></span>
I am a PhD student working on a collaborative project between the [Taschner-Mandl](https://ccri.at/research-group/sabine-taschner-mandl-group/) and [Bodenmiller](https://www.bodenmillerlab.com/#/) lab, with a background in electrical and biomedical engineering. My projects focus on multi-modal (IF & IMC) image processing, single-cell analysis and visualization in **python** and **R** to investigate tumor heterogeneity and its interaction with the microenvironment in pediatric cancer.
